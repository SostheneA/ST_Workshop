Just ensure your environment is ready, and bring your curiosity!\n\nFor troubleshooting software installation or dataset preparation, please contact the instructor ahead of time by email or via the Discord channel for support. ```\n\nAdjust package installation commands for your local IT setup if needed.\nAdd or modify data-specific instructions (e.g., ABFT) based on your actual teaching materials."
