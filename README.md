## Overview

### Description

This workshop is designed to empower fisheries scientists, ecologists, and analysts to apply cutting-edge spatiotemporal modeling and index standardization in R using VAST and sdmTMB. Participants will learn how to fit and interpret spatiotemporal Generalized Linear Mixed Effects Models, standardize survey indices, and understand the principles of robust abundance estimation and spatial statistics.

The course covers:  
- Theory and applied workflows for spatiotemporal GLMMs  
- Implementation in R with VAST and sdmTMB  
- Data visualization best practices  
- Hands-on coding and interpretation for fisheries research

### Audience

This course is ideal if you want to:  
- Learn modern approaches to index standardization for abundance estimation  
- Master spatiotemporal modeling techniques for survey, bycatch, or environmental data  
- Improve skills in R for reproducible research, diagnostics, and visualization

## Prework

- Install R (latest version) and RStudio  
- Install `VAST` and `sdmTMB`:
  ```
  install.packages("devtools")
  devtools::install_github("James-Thorson-NOAA/VAST")
  install.packages("sdmTMB")
  ```  
- Bring your own dataset (or use provided examples)  
- Review the basics of data cleaning: removing duplicates, validating spatial coordinates, etc.
