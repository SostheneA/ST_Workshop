This workshop will guide you through applied spatiotemporal modeling and robust index standardization using VAST and sdmTMB. You will learn essential R skills for fitting and diagnosing GLMMs, preparing data, and visualizing survey results---no prior advanced modeling experience required.

## Essential Software Setup

Before the course, please:

-   Install the latest version of **R** from [cloud.r-project.org](https://cloud.r-project.org/).

-   Install the **VAST** and **sdmTMB** R packages by entering the following in your R console:

    ```         
    install.packages("devtools")
    devtools::install_github("James-Thorson-NOAA/VAST")
    install.packages("sdmTMB")
    ```

-   Verify that your system can run R from the command line (`R --version` in your terminal).

-   Optionally, install **RStudio** for a streamlined coding experience.

## Data Preparation

Please make sure you have:

-   Example abundance or CPUE datasets available (either your own data or sample data provided in the course materials).
-   Familiarize yourself with basic data cleaning steps, such as:
    -   Removing duplicates and invalid entries
    -   Ensuring complete columns for key variables (e.g., species, year, location)
    -   Checking that all spatial coordinates (latitude, longitude) are expressed in consistent units and projections

If possible, bring your own messy dataset to practice hands-on cleaning and formatting.

## Course Communication

All participants are invited to join the dedicated workshop github website. Instructions for joining and sharing questions or resources will be sent prior to the event.

## Suggested Preparation Checklist

-   R and RStudio installed ✔️
-   VAST and sdmTMB packages successfully loaded ✔️
-   At least one fisheries or abundance dataset on hand ✔️
-   Ready to participate in coding and model-fitting---either on your laptop or using example data provided

No extensive pre-learning is needed. Just ensure your environment is ready, and bring your curiosity!
