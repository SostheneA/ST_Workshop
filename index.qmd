# Course Overview

This interactive workshop empowers fisheries scientists and analysts to master spatiotemporal index standardization using the VAST and sdmTMB R packages. Focusing on practical applications for Western Atlantic Bluefin Tuna (ABFT), participants will gain both theoretical understanding and robust R skills to fit, interpret, and compare modern Generalized Linear Mixed Effects Models (GLMMs) for fisheries survey data.

We demystify key concepts in index standardization---how to isolate true abundance trends amid vessel, gear, year, and spatial effects---before exploring spatial and spatiotemporal modeling using Gaussian Random Fields, SPDEs, and mesh-based approaches. Through guided modules, you will learn to prepare data, configure models, interpret outputs, and diagnose fit quality, culminating in direct application to Western ABFT.

Whether new to VAST or sdmTMB, or looking to refine advanced workflows, you will leave with practical, reproducible R code and conceptual clarity ready to be applied to your own research.

## Is this course for me?

This course will be appropriate for you if you:

-   Want effective strategies for robust index standardization and abundance estimation in survey data,
-   Aim to understand and model autocorrelation and spatiotemporal structure in fisheries datasets,
-   Wish to compare, diagnose, and visualize results across VAST and sdmTMB frameworks.
